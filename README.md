# stock-bot
This is a simple pupeteer based stock notification bot. It will scrape the stock price of a given stock from a website and send a notification to the user if the stock price changes by more than a certain percentage.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js
* Puppeteer

## Installation

npm install


## Usage

To run the bot, simply execute the following command:

```conole
node index.js
```
The bot will prompt you to enter the stock symbol and the percentage change threshold. Once you have entered these values, the bot will start scraping the stock price and send you a notification if the stock price changes by more than the threshold.

<!-- Example
node bot.js
Enter the stock symbol: AAPL
Enter the percentage change threshold: 10
The bot is now running. You will receive a notification if the stock price of AAPL changes by more than 10%. -->
